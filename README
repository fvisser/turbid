Small accounting application. To rehearse, there are five types of account:
asset (debit account)
liability (credit account)
expense (debit account)
income (credit account)
equity (credit account)

Debit accounts increase their balance if a new value is added to the
debit (left) side of the balance, credit accounts increase in value
if the credit (right) is increased

basic formula:


Assets + Draws + Expenses = Liabilities + Owner's Equity + Revenue 

assets - liabilities = equity + revenue - expense - draws
